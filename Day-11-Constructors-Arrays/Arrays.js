//arrays are collection of multiple values.
let car = ["bmw","benz","audi"];//You can define an array within square brackets
car.push("maruthi");//push is used to add the values into the array at the last.
car.pop();//pop is used to remove the last element from the array.
console.log(car);
console.log(car[2]);//if you want to fetch particular value from array you can access it using index which starts from 0.

let numbers = new Array(1,2,3);//You can also declare array like this.
