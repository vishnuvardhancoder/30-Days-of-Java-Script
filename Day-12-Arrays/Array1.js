//in js arrays can hold multiple data types like int,string,objects and functions.

let data = [1,"aa",{roll:20},function(){console.log("hi");}]

console.log(data);

//if you want to call the function you can call it with the index

//function is 3rd index in the array

data[3]();//it will call the function which will console hi.
